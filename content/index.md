RasQberry is a functional model of IBM Quantum System Two. It integrates Qiskit, a Raspberry Pi and a 3D printed model of IBM Q System Two to explore various state-of-the-art technologies and create a tool that can be used for education and in meetings, meetups, demo booths, etc. A spectrum of Quantum Computing demos and Serious Games for Quantum Computing (that illustrate e.g. superposition, interference and entanglement) will be made available on the RasQberry platform for an engaging introduction to Quantum Computing.

> **Legal Notice**: RasQberry is an independent educational project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by IBM Corporation. IBM, IBM Quantum, Qiskit, and IBM Quantum System Two are trademarks of International Business Machines Corporation. This project creates an educational tool inspired by IBM's quantum computing systems for teaching purposes.

**Note:** If you are looking for the functional model of IBM Quantum System ONE, please go to [https://rasqberry.one](https://rasqberry.one). Here is the new project, building a functional model of IBM Quantum System TWO, including several additional updates, e.g. 64-bit OS, Raspberry Pi 5, Qiskit 1.x, more Quantum Computing Demos, integration into raspi-config, etc.

## Quick Installation

Get started with RasQberry Two in three easy steps:

1. **Download** a RasQberry image from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/JanLahmann/RasQberry-Two/releases) (beta phase)
2. **Write** the image to an SD card using Raspberry Pi Imager (no customizations needed)
3. **Boot** your Raspberry Pi 5 and explore quantum computing demos

### Simplified Installation with Custom Pi Imager

For an even easier experience, use our pre-configured Pi Imager launcher that automatically loads RasQberry images:

**On macOS**, you can install a convenient Desktop launcher (one-line command):

```bash
curl -sSL https://rasqberry.org/install-rpi-imager-launcher.sh | bash
```

This creates a "Pi Imager for RasQberry" app on your Desktop with the RasQberry icon that opens Pi Imager with RasQberry images pre-loaded. You can then move it to Applications or your Dock.

Alternatively, run Pi Imager with a custom repository manually in a terminal:

```bash
/Applications/Raspberry\ Pi\ Imager.app/Contents/MacOS/rpi-imager --repo https://RasQberry.org/RQB-images.json
```

**On Windows**, you can install a convenient Desktop shortcut (one-line command):

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://rasqberry.org/install-rpi-imager-launcher.ps1'))
```

This creates a "Pi Imager for RasQberry" shortcut on your Desktop with the RasQberry icon. You can then pin it to Start Menu or Taskbar.

Alternatively, run Pi Imager manually in a command prompt:

```bash
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Raspberry Pi Imager\rpi-imager.exe" --repo https://RasQberry.org/RQB-images.json
```

### First Boot Setup

Once your RasQberry Two is running:

1. **Connect** via SSH or VNC (both work out of the box)
   - Username: `rasqberry`
   - Password: `Qiskit1!`

2. **Explore Demos** through the menu system:
   - Run `sudo raspi-config` and select the first menu item
   - Or use desktop icons to launch demos directly
   - Note: Most demos require LED strips connected to GPIO pin 21

3. **Report Issues** at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/JanLahmann/RasQberry-Two/issues)

> **Beta Note**: Additional features, demos, and improvements are continuously being added to [beta releases](https://github.com/JanLahmann/RasQberry-Two/releases).


## Working with Qiskit

Qiskit comes pre-installed in the default virtual environment (RQB2).

**Activate the environment:**
```bash
source /home/rasqberry/RasQberry-Two/venv/RQB2/bin/activate
```

**Check installed packages:**
```bash
(RQB2) rasqberry@raspberrypi:~ $ pip list | grep qiskit
qiskit                 2.0.1
qiskit-aer             0.15.1
qiskit-ibm-runtime     0.30.0
qiskit-qasm3-import    0.5.1
```

> **Note**: Package versions shown are examples. Use `pip list | grep qiskit` to see your current installation.

## Building the RasQberry 3D Model

STL files for the 3D-printed model are available in the [3D-model branch](https://github.com/JanLahmann/RasQberry-Two/tree/3D-model). The model consists of several printed parts that assemble together to create the complete RasQberry Two enclosure.

For detailed assembly instructions, see the [Hardware Assembly Guide](01-3d-model/hardware-assembly-guide).
