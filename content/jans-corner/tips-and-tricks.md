# Tips and Tricks from Jan

On this page, you will find various tips & tricks from Jan for building the 3D model (e.g. slightly modified STL files, useful tools), installing and using the SW stack and the quantum computing demos, and for modifications of the SW stack and adding new demos to the platform.

## 3D model

I have slightly modified some of the STL files to create a specific variant of the RasQberry Two model or to adjust them a bit to my environment (e.g. the specific 3D printer I use, etc).
** STL files will be added soon **

### Standalone model

The "standalone model" does not use the floor at all. The intention is to use multiple of these standalone models to resemble the modular structure of Quantum System Two, i.e. being able to rearrange the elements and build larger quantum computing structures. For that case, the holes for the screws have been removed. Also, we do not not the double wide version of the RTEs, but only the small RTEs, which then have four magents (two on each side). This allows more flexible configurations.

### LED Filter Screen

The bill-of-material mentions a "welding shield" than can be used in front of the LEDs. Instead, you can 3D print it - with the right material. Many black filaments will not work as they absorb too much light, but a screen printed with 0.6 mm Prusament PLA Galaxy Grey does just fine. STL file is here, and removes the need for a separate order of a welding shield and cutting it.

### Polarisation of the Magnets
