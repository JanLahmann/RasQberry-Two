# Quantum Computing Demos in RasQberry

This page lists several Quantum Computing demos that will be made available on RasQberry

## Raspberry Tie

Your Raspberry Pi running code on the IBM Quantum platform processors or simulators via Python 3 -- with results displayed courtesy of the 8x8 LED array on a SenseHat (or SenseHat emulator)!

## Bloch Sphere

An interactive visualization tool for understanding single-qubit quantum states and gates on the Bloch sphere. Perfect for learning how quantum gates transform qubit states.

## GHZ with multiple Qubits

This demo by Jan-R. Lahmann creates several blocks with multi-Qubit GHZ states and displays the result using the integrated LED. Simple circutis with up to 4*4*12=192 Qubits can be simulated.

## Fractals

Create stunning animated fractal art using quantum computing to generate Julia set parameters. Visualize quantum states through beautiful mathematical fractals.

## Quantum Paradoxes

Maria Violaris has published a Blog and YouTube series about [Quantum Paradoxes](https://www.mariaviolaris.com/quantum-paradoxes/), such as Schödingers Cat, Quantum Zeno Effect, Time Loops, Teleportation, Wigners Friend and others. Implementations of these paradoxes will be available on RasQberry.

## Fun with Quantum

[Fun with Quantum](http://fun-with-quantum.org) by Jan-R. Lahmann is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that highlight specific aspects of Quantum Computing that are interesting and/or fun. It is focussed on “serious games for quantum computing” and includes a coin game (introducing and explaining superposition), the GHZ game (about entanglement), and several other Qiskit notebooks.

## Qoffee-Maker

Use quantum computing to select your perfect beverage! Create the right quantum circuit, and the measurement result will determine which coffee or tea you get.

## Quantum Lights Out

A quantum computing implementation of the classic Lights Out puzzle game, solved using quantum algorithms and visualized step-by-step on the RasQberry Two LED panel.
