# Quantum Computing Demos Overview

Welcome to the RasQberry Quantum Computing Demos! This collection of interactive demonstrations brings quantum computing concepts to life through visualizations, games, and artistic creations.

## What Are These Demos?

These demos are designed to make quantum computing accessible and engaging. Each demo illustrates different quantum concepts through hands-on experiences, from visualizing quantum states to solving puzzles with quantum algorithms.

## Demo Categories

### ðŸŽ¨ Visualization & Art

**[Bloch Sphere](bloch-sphere.md)** - Interactive single-qubit state visualization
Perfect for beginners. See how quantum gates transform qubit states in real-time on the Bloch sphere.

**[Fractals](fractals.md)** - Quantum-generated fractal art
Create beautiful animated Julia set fractals using quantum-derived parameters. Art meets quantum mechanics!

**[Raspberry Tie](raspberry-tie.md)** - LED display of quantum circuit results
Run quantum circuits on IBM Quantum and visualize results on the LED array. Your quantum computer with lights!

### ðŸŽ® Games & Puzzles

**[Quantum Lights Out](quantum-lights-out.md)** - Quantum puzzle solver
Watch a quantum algorithm solve the classic Lights Out puzzle step-by-step on your LED panel.

**[Qoffee Maker](qoffee-maker.md)** - Quantum beverage selection
Design quantum circuits to select your favorite beverage. Fun introduction to quantum measurement!

**[Fun with Quantum](http://fun-with-quantum.org)** - Serious games collection
Jupyter notebooks featuring quantum games: coin games (superposition), GHZ game (entanglement), and more.

### ðŸ”¬ Advanced Concepts

**GHZ with Multiple Qubits** - Multi-qubit entanglement
Explore GHZ states with up to 192 qubits, visualized on the LED display.

**Quantum Paradoxes** - Famous thought experiments
Implementations of SchrÃ¶dinger's Cat, Quantum Zeno Effect, teleportation, and more.
