# Quantum Computing Demos available in RasQberry

This page lists several Quantum Computing demos that will be made available on RasQberry

## Raspberry Tie

Your Raspberry Pi running code on the IBM Quantum platform processors or simulators via Python 3 -- with results displayed courtesy of the 8x8 LED array on a SenseHat (or SenseHat emulator)!

Developed by Kevin Roche [GitHub: KPRoche/quantum-raspberry-tie](https://github.com/KPRoche/quantum-raspberry-tie)

## Bloch Sphere

A simple demo that helps to to understand the Bloch Sphere.

## GHZ with multiple Qubits

This demo by Jan-R. Lahmann creates several blocks with multi-Qubit GHZ states and displays the result using the integrated LED. Simple circutis with up to 4*4*12=192 Qubits can be simulated.


## Fractals

Wiktor Mazin and a team have created fractals with some quantum input: [Fractal animations with quantum computing on a Raspberry Pi](https://medium.com/qiskit/fractal-animations-with-quantum-computing-on-a-raspberry-pi-8834ef43d423)

## Quantum Paradoxes

Maria Violaris has published a YouTube series about ![Quantum Paradoxes”](https://www.mariaviolaris.com/quantum-paradoxes/). Implementations of these paradoxes will be available on RasQberry.
