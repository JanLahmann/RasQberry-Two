## Adding a New Quantum Demo

Here's a quick overview of adding a new quantum computing demonstration to RasQberry:

### 1. Create Your Demo

Develop your quantum computing demonstration using Python and Qiskit:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

# Your quantum demo logic
def my_quantum_demo():
    qc = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
    qc.h(0)
    qc.cx(0, 1)
    qc.cx(1, 2)
    # ... your demo continues
```

### 2. Package It

Create a GitHub repository with:
- Your demo code
- `requirements.txt` for dependencies
- `README.md` with description and usage
- Educational documentation

### 3. Integrate with RasQberry

- Add configuration to environment file
- Create launcher script using our template
- Add menu entry
- Document your demo

### 4. Submit

- Test thoroughly on Raspberry Pi
- Create pull request
- Respond to feedback
