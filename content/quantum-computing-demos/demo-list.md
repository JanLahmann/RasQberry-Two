# Quantum Computing Demos in RasQberry

This page lists several Quantum Computing demos that will be made available on RasQberry

## Raspberry Tie

Your Raspberry Pi running code on the IBM Quantum platform processors or simulators via Python 3 -- with results displayed courtesy of the 8x8 LED array on a SenseHat (or SenseHat emulator)!

For more details, you can check out its [./raspberry-tie.md](README file here), or visit its github repository.

Developed by Kevin Roche [GitHub: KPRoche/quantum-raspberry-tie](https://github.com/KPRoche/quantum-raspberry-tie)

## Bloch Sphere

A simple demo that helps to to understand the Bloch Sphere.

Developed by James Weaver [GitHub: JavaFXpert/grok-bloch](https://github.com/JavaFXpert/grok-bloch)

## GHZ with multiple Qubits

This demo by Jan-R. Lahmann creates several blocks with multi-Qubit GHZ states and displays the result using the integrated LED. Simple circutis with up to 4*4*12=192 Qubits can be simulated.


## Fractals

Wiktor Mazin and a team have created fractals with some quantum input: [Fractal animations with quantum computing on a Raspberry Pi](https://medium.com/qiskit/fractal-animations-with-quantum-computing-on-a-raspberry-pi-8834ef43d423)

## Quantum Paradoxes

Maria Violaris has published a Blog and YouTube series about [Quantum Paradoxes](https://www.mariaviolaris.com/quantum-paradoxes/), such as Schödingers Cat, Quantum Zeno Effect, Time Loops, Teleportation, Wigners Friend and others. Implementations of these paradoxes will be available on RasQberry.

## Fun with Quantum

[Fun with Quantum](http://fun-with-quantum.org) by Jan-R. Lahmann is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that highlight specific aspects of Quantum Computing that are interesting and/or fun. It is focussed on “serious games for quantum computing” and includes a coin game (introducing and explaining superposition), the GHZ game (about entanglement), and several other Qiskit notebooks.


## Qoffee-Maker

[Qoffee.Maker.org](https://qoffee-maker.org) by Jan-R. Lahmann is based on Quantum Computing and will produce a coffee, capuccino, etc based on the measurement result of a Quantum Circuit.

To get your favorite type of beverage implies creating a quantum circuit whose measurement result is the appropriate representing binary number.
