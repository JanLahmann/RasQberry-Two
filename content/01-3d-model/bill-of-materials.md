# Bill of Materials

This document contains all the information you need to purchase everything needed to assemble the RasQberry Two Platform. When fully assembled, you will have a functional and detailed model like this one!

<p align='center'><img src='../Artwork/RasQberry2model.png' width="88%" height="88%"/></p>

The **Required Components** section provides a handy list of every component needed for the basic model as well as any optional additions.

The **Bill of Materials** section organizes every component into an easy to read table with accompanying important information such as cost, quantity and purchase links.

### Contributors

The following people have contributed to the development of the documentation:

Luka Dojcinovic, Andy Stanford-Clark, Eric H Jenney, Jan-Rainer Lahmann, Sascha Schefenacker

You can contact any of us with questions, concerns or suggestions for changes to the hardware specs and the assembly guide.

### Guiding Principles

These are the key tenets that we strive to follow when designing and assembling the hardware of the RasQberry Two.

1. The RasQberry Two platform will be an Open Platform that anyone can access and anyone can contribute to. All code provided, along with the 3D models and the hardware assembly procedure, will be open source.

2. Two tiers of the project will be provided; Core and Optional. The Core tier will be all the necessary components needed to create the base RasQberry Two model, with an emphasis on making it as cost effective and easy to procure as possible. The Optional tier will include optional components that enhance the functionality of the model if the user would like to expand on the Core tier.

3. The RasQberry Two should be easy to procure; the components should be readily available and different store page links should be provided for people around the world.

4. The RasQberry Two should be easy to assemble; someone with little to no prior hardware experience should be able to assemble it by following the instructions.

5. There should be no soldering required to assemble the RasQberry Two.

6. When possible, the RasQberry Two should faithfully recreate the real world quantum computer it is based on.

7. The RasQberry Two should serve as a fun and creative way to educate about quantum computers and how they work.

## Required Components

### Core Components:

The following core components are necessary to create the base functioning model of the RasQberry Two. It includes all the components needed for the enclosure model, the LEDs and the operation of the Raspberry Pi at the heart of this project.

#### Raspberry Pi:

- Raspberry Pi 5 2GB or Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB

  - <em>2 GB of RAM for the Pi 5 is sufficient for day to day tasks and most of the quantum demos. If a demo runs poorly with 2GB of RAM, it will be noted in the demo's info.</em>

  - <em>The Pi 5 is recommended for this project, however a Pi 4B can be used as well. Alternatives to some components will be needed if the Pi 4B is used (power supply, cooling fan etc.). The cooling configuration with a Pi 4B has not been tested, due to the lack of a standard cooler for the Pi 4B. If using a Pi 4B, a PWM fan of some kind mounted above the CPU is recommended. Additionally, the wiring to the LED array is different for the Pi 4.</em>

  - **The hardware assembly guide will assume that a Raspberry Pi 5 is used.**

- Raspberry Pi 5 27W USB-C Power Supply

- Raspberry Pi 5 Active Cooler

- Minimum 32GB MicroSD card

  - **Note**: <em>For compiling the OS image from source, a 128GB MicroSD is needed due to PyGen. For most people, compiling from source will not be needed. Instead, it is recommended to download and install the release image, which is already compiled, for which 32GB will be more than sufficient.</em>

- Right Angle USB-C Adapter

- Right Angle HDMI adapter (Make sure right direction)

#### LED Array:

- WS2812IC 4Ã—12 LED Panel (4 of them)

- Male to Female Breadboard Jumper Wires

- Filter screen for LEDs

#### Enclosure:

- An FDM 3D Printer or access to one

- PLA Filament

> **Note**: Multiple colors of PLA are needed to achieve the desired look. The specific colors and total amounts of PLA have been listed in the BOM below.
> <br/>

#### Miscellaneous:

- Magnets

- Nuts and Bolts

- Screws

### 3D Model Files:

The 3D Model STL files for the RasQberry Two Platform can be found [here](https://github.com/JanLahmann/RasQberry-Two/tree/3D-model/3D%20Model). The RasQberry Two's Model is divided into the following sections: The Wall, The Floor, The Cryostat and the RTEs. The filament colors and the amount needed for each section of the model can be found in the table below, in the row labeled: **3D Printer Filament**.

### Optional (Nice to Have) Components:

The following components are optional. They are not required for the core functions of the RasQberry Two, but they can enhance the experience and provide features such as portability and extra illumination.

- Geekworm X1203 UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)

- Battery pack holder

- 18650 Batteries (2 of them)

- USB-C Power Switch

- LED Ring for Cryo-illumination
