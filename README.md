## üìö How to Add Content

The website builds its pages dynamically from the [content](https://github.com/JanLahmann/RasQberry-Two/tree/gh-pages/content) folder. Each Markdown file in this folder corresponds to a page on the site, maintaining the folder's route hierarchy.

### Markdown File Structure

Each Markdown file consists of:

1. **Frontmatter (Optional):** YAML configuration enclosed in `---`. This section specifies metadata and page attributes.
2. **Content:** The main body written in standard Markdown syntax.

### Frontmatter Attributes

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of available attributes for configuration:

```
leadspace:
  title: string             # Title of the page
  copy: string              # Subtitle or description
  size: tall | short | super # Height of the leadspace section
  cta:                      # Optional Call-to-Action configuration
    primary:
      label: string         # Button text
      url: string           # Button URL
      icon: logo-github | arrow-right # Icon for the button
  bg:                       # Optional background settings
    image:
      src: string           # Image URL
      alt: string           # Alt text for the image
tableOfContent:
  disabled: boolean         # Disable TOC for this page (true/false) default false
  minLevel: number          # Minimum header level to include in TOC
  maxLevel: number          # Maximum header level to include in TOC
```
